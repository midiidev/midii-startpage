# Midii Start Page

I really wanted a custom new tab page, so I made one.

This is not even close to what I want it to eventually be, so I'll continue development

oh yeah also when you build it, make sure to remove the `/` from the beginning
of the asset links in `dist/index.html` or else the extension won't work

you can also just use the little express server I provided instead of loading
an unpacked extension or packing it yourself and modifying the code
